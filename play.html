    <h4>THE DIABOLICAL CIRCLE</h4>
    <h6>BY

        BEULAH BORNSTEAD</h6>

<h6 class="cotton">COTTON</h6><p class="speech">
But you must understand that marriage, my daughter, is a most
reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility.</p>
<h6 class="betty">BETTY</h6><p class="direction">[_Thoughtfully._]</p><p class="speech">  Truly reverend and most serious, father
</p><p class="direction">[_looking up roguishly_]</p><p class="direction"> but I like not so much of the grave about it.</p>

<h6 class="name">COTTON</h6>
    <p class="direction">[_Continuing._] </p><p class="speech">I fear thou lookest upon the matter too lightly.
It is not seemly to treat such a momentous occasion thus flippantly.</p>
<h6 class="name">BETTY</h6><p class="direction">
 [_Protesting._]</p><p class="speech"> Nay, father, why consider it at all? Marriage is
yet a great way off. Mayhap I shall never leave thee.</p>
<h6 class="name">COTTON</h6><p class="speech">
Thou little thinkest that I may be suddenly called on to leave
_thee_. The Good Word cautions us to boast not ourselves of the morrow,
for we know not what a day may bring forth.</p>
<h6 class="name">BETTY</h6><p class="direction">
[_Dropping her knitting._]</p><p class="speech"> Father, thou art not feeling well.
Perhaps----</p>
<h6 class="name">COTTON</h6><p class="speech">
Nay, child, be not alarmed. 'Tis but a most necessary lesson to
be learned and laid up in the heart. I will not always be with thee and
I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
go.</p>
<h6 class="name">BETTY</h6><p class="direction">
[_Picking her knitting up._]</p><p class="speech"> Be comfortably assured, then, I
prithee; I have no fears.</p>

<h6 class="name">COTTON</h6><p class="direction"> [_Bringing his arm down forcibly on the arm of the chair._]</p><p class="speech"> Aye!
There it is. Thou hast no fears. Would that thou had'st some!</p> <p class="direction"> up
at the portrait._]</p><p class="speech"> Had thy prudent and virtuous mother only lived to
point the way, I might be spared this anxiety; but, beset by diverse
difficulties in establishing the kingdom of God in this country, and
sorely harassed by many hardships and by evil men, I fear me I have not
propounded to thee much that I ought.</p>
