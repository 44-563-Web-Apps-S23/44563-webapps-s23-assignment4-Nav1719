<h6>COTTON</h6>        <p>
But you must understand that marriage, my daughter, is a most
reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility.</p>
<h6>BETTY</h6><p> [_Thoughtfully._] Truly reverend and most serious, father
[_looking up roguishly_], but I like not so much of the grave about it.</p>

<h6>COTTON</h6><p>
_Continuing._] I fear thou lookest upon the matter too lightly.
It is not seemly to treat such a momentous occasion thus flippantly.</p>
<h6>BETTY</h6><p>
 [_Protesting._] Nay, father, why consider it at all? Marriage is
yet a great way off. Mayhap I shall never leave thee.</p>
<h6>COTTON</h6><p>
Thou little thinkest that I may be suddenly called on to leave
_thee_. The Good Word cautions us to boast not ourselves of the morrow,
for we know not what a day may bring forth.</p>
<h6>BETTY</h6><p>
[_Dropping her knitting._] Father, thou art not feeling well.
Perhaps----</p>
<h6>COTTON</h6><p>
Nay, child, be not alarmed. 'Tis but a most necessary lesson to
be learned and laid up in the heart. I will not always be with thee and
I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
go.</p>
<h6>BETTY</h6><p>
[_Picking her knitting up._] Be comfortably assured, then, I
prithee; I have no fears.</p>
<p>
<h6>COTTON</h6> [_Bringing his arm down forcibly on the arm of the chair._] Aye!
There it is. Thou hast no fears. Would that thou had'st some! [_Looks up
at the portrait._] Had thy prudent and virtuous mother only lived to
point the way, I might be spared this anxiety; but, beset by diverse
difficulties in establishing the kingdom of God in this country, and
sorely harassed by many hardships and by evil men, I fear me I have not
propounded to thee much that I ought.</p>
