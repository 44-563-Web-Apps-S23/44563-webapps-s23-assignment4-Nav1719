    _As the curtain rises_ COTTON MATHER _is seated in a large armchair
    by the fire, with_ BETTY _on a stool at his feet, with her
    knitting_.</p>
<p>
    COTTON, _his hair already touched with the whitening frost of many
    a severe New England winter, is grave and sedate. Very much
    exercised with the perils of this life, and serenely contemplative
    of the life to come, he takes himself and the world about him very
    seriously._</p>
<p>
    _Not so with_ MISTRESS BETTY. _Outwardly demure, yet inwardly
    rebellious against the straitened conventions of the times, she
    dimples over with roguish merriment upon the slightest
    provocation._</p>
<p>
    _As we first see them_ COTTON _is giving_ BETTY _some timely
    advice_.</p>
<p>
COTTON. But you must understand that marriage, my daughter, is a most
reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility.</p>
<p>
BETTY. [_Thoughtfully._] Truly reverend and most serious, father
[_looking up roguishly_], but I like not so much of the grave about it.</p>
<p>
COTTON. [_Continuing._] I fear thou lookest upon the matter too lightly.
It is not seemly to treat such a momentous occasion thus flippantly.</p>
<p>
BETTY. [_Protesting._] Nay, father, why consider it at all? Marriage is
yet a great way off. Mayhap I shall never leave thee.</p>
<p>
COTTON. Thou little thinkest that I may be suddenly called on to leave
_thee_. The Good Word cautions us to boast not ourselves of the morrow,
for we know not what a day may bring forth.</p>
<p>
BETTY. [_Dropping her knitting._] Father, thou art not feeling well.
Perhaps----</p>
<p>
COTTON. Nay, child, be not alarmed. 'Tis but a most necessary lesson to
be learned and laid up in the heart. I will not always be with thee and
I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
go.</p>
<p>
BETTY. [_Picking her knitting up._] Be comfortably assured, then, I
prithee; I have no fears.</p>
<p>
COTTON. [_Bringing his arm down forcibly on the arm of the chair._] Aye!
There it is. Thou hast no fears. Would that thou had'st some! [_Looks up
at the portrait._] Had thy prudent and virtuous mother only lived to
point the way, I might be spared this anxiety; but, beset by diverse
difficulties in establishing the kingdom of God in this country, and
sorely harassed by many hardships and by evil men, I fear me I have not
propounded to thee much that I ought.</p>
